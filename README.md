## How to get started - Windows

### Bundled installer
Download and execute the bundled installer `Waterproof.and.Coq.Setup.[version].exe` from the [release page](http://github.com/impermeable/waterproof/releases).
**Note:** do not change the default installation location, otherwise Waterproof will not work.

### Separate installers for dependencies and Waterproof
* Download and execute the dependencies installer from its [release page](https://github.com/impermeable/waterproof-dependencies-installer/releases). **Note:** do not change the default installation location, otherwise Waterproof will not work.
* Install Waterproof using the installer `Waterproof.Setup.[version].exe` from the [release page](http://github.com/impermeable/waterproof/releases).

## How to get started - Linux and Mac

The easiest way to get started with Waterproof on Linux or Mac is to follow the steps:

* Step 1. Install SerAPI and coq-waterproof following the steps below
* Step 2. Install Waterproof using the installer from the [release page](http://github.com/impermeable/waterproof/releases)

### Step 1 for MacOS and Linux. Installation of SerAPI.

The following steps (1.a, 1.b, 1.c and 1.d) describe how to install SerAPI and coq-waterproof on MacOS or Linux.

#### Step 1.a for MacOS and Linux: Install opam

##### On MacOS: 
Install opam. You can either do so throug homebrew (https://brew.sh/) or through MacPorts (https://www.macports.org/). If you want to use homebrew, you can run the following commands in the terminal (taken from https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html#OSX)
```
brew install gpatch
brew install opam
```

If you prefer MacPorts, instead run
```
port install opam
```

##### On Linux:
Install opam, following instructions on https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html. For instance, for **Ubuntu**:
```
add-apt-repository ppa:avsm/ppa
apt update
apt install opam
```

#### Step 1.b for MacOS and Linux: Install an OCaml compiler

In the terminal, execute the following commands (corresponding to instructions on https://ocaml.org/docs/install.html).

The first steps are common to all operating systems. First initialize the environment with
```
opam init
```
This may take a few minutes. In the meantime, opam will likely ask two questions. We recommend choosing 'y' to both, i.e. to opam modifying the `.bash_profile` and to opam adding a hook to the init scripts. Now execute the following line
```
eval $(opam env)
opam switch create 4.11.1
eval $(opam env)
```

#### Step 1.c for MacOS and Linux: Install SerAPI with opam

After installing OCaml, run the following command in the terminal:

```
opam install coq-serapi.8.15.0+0.15.2
```

Opam will ask to install several packages. Choose 'y' to install them. This step will at least take several minutes, but may take up to an hour.

Finally, execute again

```
eval $(opam env)
```

#### Step 1.d for MacOS and Linux: Install the coq-waterproof library

Navigate in the terminal to a folder in which you are willing to place a folder with necessary library files. Then run:

```
git clone https://github.com/impermeable/coq-waterproof
cd coq-waterproof
make
make install
```


### Step 2. Install Waterproof with the installer from the release page

After installing SerAPI, you are ready to install Waterproof using your preferred installer from the [release page](http://github.com/impermeable/waterproof/releases). After installing Waterproof, it will ask you to point to a program called **sertop**. This is located in a hidden file folder. To show hidden file folders in file chooser on MacOS press **âŒ˜ + Shift + .** . On Linux, right-click somewhere in the file chooser and choose "Show hidden files".

> **Known issue**: Because Waterproof is relatively unknown software, it is possible that it will initially be blocked by a virus scanner. To run Waterproof anyway: **on Windows:** Choose 'run anyway', **on Mac:** right-click and choose 'open software'; you may need to go to security settings to allow for running the app.

If you rather build the application yourself, you can follow [these steps](documentation/Cloning-the-repository.md).
