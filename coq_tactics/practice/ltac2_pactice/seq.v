For parsing input to "Ltac2 Notation", 
there is the seq() syntactic class.
Unfortunately the documentation does not describe how
to handle the variables that are parsed by this...

Experimental result: use pattern matching,
denoting the sequence as a tuple enclosed by "(" and ")",
with values separated by ",".
