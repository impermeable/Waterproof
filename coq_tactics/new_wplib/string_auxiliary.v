(** * replace_at_pos
    Replace a single character at a string and return the result.

    Arguments:
        - [s : string], the string to modify.
        - [pos : int], the index of the character to replace.
            Counting starts at 0.
        - [c : char], the replacement character.

    Returns:
        - [string]: same as [s], 
            but with the character at [pos]
            replaced with [c].

    Raises exceptions:
        - [Out_of_bounds], if [pos] is greater or equal to the
            length of  [s].
*)

    (String.set s pos c; s).


(** * copy_to_target
    Copy substring of [source] into [target].
    Replaces previously present part of [target].
    In Python notation: copy source[source_idx:source_end] to 
    target[target_idx: target_idx + (source_end - source_idx)]

    Arguments:
        - [source_idx : int], starting index of substring to copy from [source]
        - [target_idx: int], position of [target] where substring 
            should be pasted.
        - [source_end : int], fist index of [source] 
            that should not be part of substring.
            Note that [source_end - 1] is the last index that is included
            in the substring.
        - [source: string], string to copy substring from.
        - [target: string], string to copy substring into.

    Returns:
        - [string: same] as [target] but with with the characters at indices
            [target_idx] up to [target_idx + (source_end - source_idx)] replaced
            with the the characters of [source] between 
            [source_idx] and (not including) [source_end].

    Raises exceptions:
        - [Out_of_bounds], if one of the following indices does not exist:
            - [source_idx] or [source_end-1]  in [source].
            - [target_idx] in [target].
            - [target_idx + (source_end - source_idx)] in target.

    end.

(** * copy_suffix_to_target
    Copy the suffix (starting at index [source_idx]) of [source]
    intro [target] at position [target_idx].
    In Python notation:
        "return target[:target_idx] + source[source_idx:] 
                + target[len(source) + target_idx:]"


    Arguments:
        - [source_idx : int], starting index of substring (suffix) 
            to copy from [source]
        - [target_idx: int], position of [target] where the substring 
            should be pasted.
        - [source: string], string to copy substring from.
        - [target: string], string to copy substring into.

    Returns:
        - [string], same as [target] but with with the characters at indices
        [target_idx] up to [target_idx + String.length(source)] replaced
        with the the characters of [source] starting at index [source_idx].

    Raises exceptions:
        - [Out_of_bounds], if one of the following indices does not exist:
            - [source_idx] in [source].
            - [target_idx] in [target].
            - [target_idx + String.length(source)] in target.

(** * concat_strings
    Concatenate two strings and return a longer string.

    Arguments:
        - [s1 : string], string to form the prefix of the output.
        - [s2 : string], string to form the suffix of the output.

    Returns:
        - [string], concatenation of [s1] and [s2].

Ltac2 Type exn ::= [ AddToIdentNameError(string) ].
(** * add_to_ident_name
    Add a string to an ident and return it as a new ident.

    Arguments:
        - [h: ident], the ident to extend.
        - [s: string], the string to add.
    Returns:
        - [ident], concatenation of string representation of [h] and [s],
            and converted back to [ident].
