(** * waterprove
    Calls the automation tactics [auto], [eauto] and [intuition], 
    with a specific set of lemmas.

    Arguments:
        - [t: constr], the result to be proven by automation.
        - [s: constr], the list of lemmas to be used in the automation tactics.
        - [n: int], the search depth.

    Does:
        - Calls the automation tactics [auto], [eauto], [intuition (auto)] and [intuition (eauto)], 
          in this order, with search of depth equal to [n] and with the set of lemmas supplied by [s].
        - If no proof is found, print a message conveying the failture.

    Raises exceptions:
        - [AutomationFailure], if no proof of [t] was found.
