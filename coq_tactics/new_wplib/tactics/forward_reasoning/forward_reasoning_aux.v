    2.

(** * waterprove_with_hint
    First print an hint for reaching the target goal,
    try to prove the goal immediately afterward.

    Arguments:
        - [target_goal: constr], the goal to prove. 
        - [lemmas: constr], lemmas to pass to [waterprove] for automatically
            proving the [target_goal].

    print (of_string "Waterproof could not find a proof. 
If you believe the statement should hold, 
try making a smaller step.").

(** * unwrap_optional_lemma
    Given an optional lemma, either returns the lemma itself,
    or case the argument is [None], returns a dummy lemma.

    Arguments:
        - [lemma: constr option], one of the following:
            - a [constr] referring to a lemma, wrapped in [Some].
            - the value [None]
    
    Returns:
        - [constr]: the provided lemma, or [dummy_lemma] in case
            the input was [None]. [dummy_lemma] simply states that [0=0].
*)
Ltac2 unwrap_optional_lemma (lemma: constr option) :=
    match lemma with
    | None => constr:(dummy_lemma)
    | Some y => y
