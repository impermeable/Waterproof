(** * target_equals_goal_judgementally
    Check if [target] is judgementally (i.e. by rewriting definitions)
    equal to the goal.

    Arguments:
        - [target:constr], expression to compare to goal.

    Returns:
        - [bool],
            - [true], if [target] is judgementally equal 
                to the goal under focus.

(** * solve_remainder_proof
    Check if the given [target_goal] equals the actual goal under focus.
    If they are different, raise an error.
    If they are equivalent after rewriting, raise an error and continue.
    If the [target_goal] is equivalent to the goal under focus,
    finish the proof automatically with the given lemma.

    Arguments:

            (I.e. the goal is too difficult, or does not hold).
        - [AutomationFailure], if [target_goal] is not equivalent
