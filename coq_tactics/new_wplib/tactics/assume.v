[Assume] can be used to introduce the premise of an implication (⇒)
as an hypothesis. 
It expectes a type annotation for each hypothesis, and performs type-checking,

(** * intro_hyp_from_list
    Given a list of [(ident, constr)] tuples and a hypothesis [h],
    searches the list if it contains an entry [(s, t)]
    such that [t] judgementally equals the type of [h].
    As soon as such a tuple is found, [h] is renamed to [s],
    and a copy of the list with with matching [(s, t)] tuple removed
    is be returned.

    Arguments:
        - [x: (ident*constr) list], a list tuples, 
            which are pairs (hypothesis name, hypothesis type).
        - [h: ident], the ident of a hypothesis in the current context.
            [Control.hyp h] should exist.

    Returns:
        - [(ident*constr) list], a copy [x'] of [x], such [(s, t) ∉ x'], 
            where [(s, t) ∈ x] is the first entry in [x] such that
            [t] is judgementally equal to [Control.hyp h].

    Raises Exceptions:
        * [AssumeError], if there exists no [(s, t) ∈ x] such that
            [t] is judgementally equal to [Control.hyp h].

    Function to check if a hypothesis is in a list.
    Very similar to "intro_hyp_from_list", but does not do renaming

    Given a list of [(ident, constr)] tuples and a hypothesis [h],

        - [x: (ident*constr) list], a list tuples,

        - [h: ident], the ident of a hypothesis in the current context.
            [Control.hyp h] should exist.

    Returns:

            - [true] if such a tuple [(s, t)], where [t] matches
            the definition of [h], is found

(** * assume_premise_with_breakdown
    Take a list of [(ident : constr)] tuples,
    where each tuple is a pair of a hypothesis name and its body.
    Try to assume all premises of the goal,
    and rename them accordingly to the input list.
    If needed to match the specified hypotheses in the list,
    automatically break down hypotheses of the form [h = h1 /\ h2]
    into [h1] and [h2]. 
    If the goal is of the form [A -> B -> C] 
    break it down to hypotheses [A] and [B] with goal [C]
    before matching with and renaming according to the input list list.
    Raise an error if the input list does not cover all hypotheses,
    or if it contains too many hypotheses.
    
    Arguments:
        - [x : (ident*constr) list], list of tuples, 
            which are (hypothesis name, hypothesis body) pairs.
  
    Raises Exceptions:
        - [AssumeError], if [x] contains too many hypotheses
