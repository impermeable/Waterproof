(** * set_power
    Calls the automation tactics [auto], [eauto] and [firstorder], 
    with the [sets] database.

    Arguments:
        - no arguments.

    Does:
        - Calls the automation tactics [auto], [eauto], [firstorder (auto)] and [firstorder (eauto)], 
          in this order, with the [sets] database.
        - If no proof is found, print a message conveying the failture.

    Raises exceptions:
        - [SetAutomationFailure], if no proof of was found.

(** * destruct_sets
    Destructs a statement regarding an element being contained in a union/intersection of two sets into
    its respective cases.

    Arguments:
        - no arguments.

    Does:
        - matches the goal with two possibilities: an element being contained in an intersection of sets
          or an element being contained in a union of sets.
        - in the first case, it just splits the goal into its respective subcases (i.e. the element
          being contained in every set in the intersecion).
        - in the second case, it just splits the goal into its respective subcases (i.e. the element
          being containined in one such set from the union), and then tries the [set_power] function.
*)
Ltac2 destruct_sets () :=
    lazy_match! goal with
        | [h : In _ (Intersection _ _ _) _ |- _ ] => let h_val := Control.hyp h in destruct $h_val

    end.



(** * trivial_set_inclusion
    Tries to prove a set inclusion.

    Arguments:
        - no arguments.

    Does:
        - calls the tactics/functions [intro], [intro], [destruct_sets], [contradiction] and [set_power],
          in this order, in order to automatically prove a set inclusion.
*)
Ltac2 trivial_set_inclusion () :=
    try (intro x); try (intro h); try (destruct_sets ()); ltac1:(try contradiction); try (set_power ()).



(** * trivial_set_equality
    Prove a trivial set equality.

    Arguments:
        - no arguments.

    Does:
        - calls the tactics/functions [intros], [intros], [apply Extensionality_Ensembles],
          [unfold Same_set], [unfold Included], [split], and twice [trivial_set_inclusion],
          in order to prove a set equality.
