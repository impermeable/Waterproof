    Arguments:
        - [s: ident], the [ident] of the AND hypothesis.
        - [u: ident], the name of the first part of [s].
        - [v: ident], the name of the second part of [s].

    Does:
        - splits [s] into its two respective parts.

    Arguments:
        - [s: ident], the [ident] of the OR hypothesis.
