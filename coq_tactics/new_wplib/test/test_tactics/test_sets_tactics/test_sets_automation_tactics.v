(** Test 0: U \ U = ∅ *)
Goal (Empty_set U) = (Setminus _ (Full_set U) (Full_set U)).
Proof.
    This set equality is trivial.
Qed.


(** Test 1: U \ ∅ = U *)
Goal (Full_set U) = (Setminus _ (Full_set U) (Empty_set U)).
Proof.
    This set equality is trivial.
Qed.


(** Test 2: A and ∅ are disjoint *)
Goal (Disjoint _ A (Empty_set U)).
Proof.
    This set equality is trivial.
Qed.


(** Test 3: A ∩ B = B ∩ A *)
Goal (Intersection _ A B) = (Intersection _ B A).
Proof.
    This set equality is trivial.
Qed.


(** Test 4: A ∪ B = B ∪ A *)
Goal (Union _ A B) = (Union _ B A).
Proof.
    This set equality is trivial.
Qed.


(** Test 5: ∅ ∩ A = ∅ *)
Goal (Intersection _ (Empty_set U) A) = (Empty_set U).
Proof.
    This set equality is trivial.
Qed.


(** Test 6: U ∩ A = A if A ⊂ U *)
Goal ((Intersection _ (Full_set U) A) = A).
Proof.
    This set equality is trivial.
Qed.
