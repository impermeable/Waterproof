(* lra only works in the [R_scope] *)
Local Open Scope R_scope.
Lemma zero_lt_one: 0 < 1.
Proof.
    ltac1:(lra).
Qed.

(* This axiom does not make sense, 
    but therefore we can be sure that [waterprove]
    does not know it without *explicitly* being told to use it.*)
Axiom zero_is_ten: 0 = 10.

(** * Testcases for [We conclude that ... ] *)
Ltac2 Eval (print (of_string "

Testcases for [We conclude that ...]:" )).

(** * Test 1
    Base case: should easily be possible to finish the goal.
*)
Lemma test_we_conclude_1: True.
Proof.
    We conclude that True.
Qed.

(** * Test 2
    Error case: wrong goal provided.
*)
Lemma test_we_conclude_2: True.
Proof.
    let result () := We conclude that False in
    assert_raises_error result.
Abort.

(** * Test 3
    Warning case: provided goal is equivalent, 
        but uses an alternative notation.
*)
Lemma test_we_conclude_3: 2 = 2.
Proof.
    Ltac2 Eval (print (of_string "Should raise warning:")).
    We conclude that (1+1 = 2).
Qed.

(** * Test 4
    Base case, like test 1 but more complex goal.
*)
Lemma test_we_conclude_4: forall A: Prop, (A \/ ~A  -> True).
Proof.
    intros A h.
    We conclude that (True).
Qed.

(** * Test 5
    Error case: Waterprove cannot find proof
    (because the statement is false!).
*)
Lemma test_we_conclude_5: 0 = 1.
Proof.
    let result () := We conclude that (0 = 1) in
    assert_raises_error result.
Abort.

(** * Test 6
    Alternative [It follows that ...] notation.
*)
Lemma test_we_conclude_6: True.
Proof.
    It follows that True.
Qed.

(** * Testcases for [By ... we conclude that ... ] *)
Ltac2 Eval (print (of_string "

Testcases for [By ... we conclude that ...]:" )).

(** * Test 1
    Base case: should easily be possible to finish the goal,
    even with the provided lemma.

    NOTE: this test would also pass if we just
    write 
    [We conclude that (2 = 1).]
    Applarently, waterprove is powerful enough to apply symmetry to hypotheses.
*)
Lemma test_by_we_conclude_1: (1 = 2) -> (2 = 1).
Proof.
    intros h.
    apply eq_sym in h. (* Rewrite h as (2 = 1) using symmetry of "="*)
    By h we conclude that (2 = 1).
Qed.


(** * Test 2
    Base case: should easily be possible to finish the goal,
    but only with the given lemma.
*)
Lemma test_by_we_conclude_2: 0 + 0 = 20.
Proof.
    
    assert (zero_plus_zero_is_twenty: 0+0 = 20).
    rewrite zero_is_ten. (* Get goal: [10 + 10 = 20]*)
    ltac1:(lra).

    (* This is just to test if the extra lemma is really needed: *)
    let failure () := We conclude that (0 + 0 = 10) in
    assert_raises_error failure.
    
    By zero_plus_zero_is_twenty we conclude that (0 + 0 = 20).
Qed.

(** * Test 3
    Warning case: provided goal is equivalent, 
        but uses an alternative notation.
*)
Lemma test_by_we_conclude_3: 2 = 1 + 1.
Proof.
    Ltac2 Eval (print (of_string "Should raise warning:")).
    By zero_lt_one we conclude that (2 = 2).
Qed.

(** * Test 4
    Error case: Waterprove cannot find proof
    (because the statement is false,
    even with the given lemma).
*)
Lemma test_by_we_conclude_4: 0 = 1.
Proof.
    let result () := By zero_is_ten we conclude that (0 = 1) in
    assert_raises_error result.
Abort.

(** * Test 5
    Shows that [waterprove]
    can solve [(1 < 2)]
    without explcitly being given 
    the lemma that states [0 < 1].
*)
Lemma test_by_we_conclude_5: 1 < 2.
Proof.
    assert (useless: 1 = 1).
    reflexivity.

    By useless we conclude that (1 < 2).
Qed.

(** * Example for the SUM.
    Somewhat more realistic context.
*)

Open Scope nat_scope.
Inductive even : nat -> Prop :=
    even0 : even 0
  | evenS : forall x:nat, even x -> even (S (S x)).

Lemma sum_example_by_we_conclude: forall x:nat, x = 2 -> even x.
Proof.
    intros x h.
    rewrite h. (* Change the goal to "even 2"*)
    apply evenS. (* Change the goal to "even 0"*)
    By even0 we conclude that (even 0).
Qed.
