(** Test 0: This should work just fine, by applying a hypothesis *)
Goal forall n : nat, exists m : nat, (n = m).
Proof.
    intro.
    assert (n = n) as X.
    {
        reflexivity.
    }
    pose (m := n).
    exists m.
    Apply X.
Defined.


(** Test 1: This should also work just fine, by applying a lemma *)

Lemma my_refl (n : nat) : n = n.
Proof.
    reflexivity.
Defined.

Goal forall n : nat, n = n.
Proof.
    intro n.
    Apply (my_refl n).
Defined.
