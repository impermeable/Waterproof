(** * Testcases for [It suffices to show that ...] 
    Variant without the [by] clause.
*)

Open Scope nat_scope.

(** * Test 1
    Base case: give a statement that indeed suffices.
*)
Lemma test_it_suffices_1: forall x:nat, x>0 /\ x < 2 -> x = S (0).
Proof.
    intros x.
    It suffices to show that (x = 1).
    (* Old goal should have been proven by the above,
        now the assumption used remains to be proven.*)
    assert_goal_is constr:(x=1).
Abort.

(** * Test 2
    Error case: give a statement does not suffice to complete the proof.
*)
Lemma test_it_suffices_2: forall A B : Prop , A /\ A -> B.
Proof.
    intros A B.
    (* Clearly this statement isn't helpful in proving the goal! *)
    let result () := It suffices to show that (1 + 1 = 2) in
    assert_raises_error result.
Abort.

(** * Testcases for [It suffices to show that ... by ...] 
    Variant with the [by] clause.
*)

(** * Test 1
    Basic case: correct tactic given, but useless statement.
*)
Lemma test_it_suffices_by_1: 0 <> 1.
Proof.
    let tac := trivial in
    It suffices to show that (0 = 0) by tac.
Qed.

Inductive even : nat -> Prop :=
    even0 : even 0
  | evenS : forall x:nat, even x -> even (S (S x)).


(** * Test 2
    Basic case: correct tactic given, and usefull statement.
*)
Lemma test_it_suffices_by_2: even 4.
Proof.
    It suffices to show that (even 2) by (apply evenS;assumption).
Abort.

(** * Test 3
    Error case: the given tactic does not prove it.
*)
Lemma test_it_suffices_by_3: 0 <> 1.
Proof.
    let result () := It suffices to show that (1 <> 0) by reflexivity in
    assert_raises_error result.
Abort.
